    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Jaden likes banana bread with chocolate chips in it.

        I am currently a student at Parsons School of Design in the Design and Techbology Major.

        I love filmmaking, basketball, and honestly everything around color. I have been spending the past semester learning as much as I can about color theory and light, and how both tie to filmmaking.

        My dream is to be a director and own my own studio. My studio would direct various films and campaigns for other large brands, and our own projects.

        I lack experience with really all of coding and technology, but I hope to expand my understanding so that I might be able to think of new and different solutions within filmmaking.

        If anyone is baking banana bread (with no nuts) let me know ASAP!

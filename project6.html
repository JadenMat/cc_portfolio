    I remember as a kid the three games/toys I would see as advertisements growing up were Kinetic Sand Advertisements, Fruit Ninja, and connect four. I used to love watching cartoons when this sudden ads would pop up, and in all honesty it reminds me of my childhood before my older brothers went off to college. In between this time, we ended up moving which for me cataloged a stage where my I began to grow up, so in a sense, moving from our old house to a new one had shifted the games and ads I remember seeing.

As a memento towards these old games and house I used to live in, I painted two rooms from our old house and connected them to basic variations of the games I remember. I used plenty of help from the youtube videos cited, and chatGPT with error messages, and attempted the best I had at using scenes to shift focus!

In game 1, the goal is to fill the scene with sand, no particular gimmick, but the reference video was very inciteful in providing support in how to create a sand situation, and I remember finding this experience to be very similar to the way I saw Kinetic Sand advertisements which shifted my approach to this whole project.

Second game is my attempt at a basic fruit ninja structure, you click the fruit as the time gets faster and faster to see how many you can get!

Third game is a simple game of connect 4, find a friend so you guys can play together!

I hope you enjoy or find it interesting!
